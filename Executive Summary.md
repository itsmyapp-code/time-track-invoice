Executive Summary
Time Track Invoice is an impressive and well-conceived application that is far more advanced than a typical version 1.0.0 product. It successfully combines the essential functions of time tracking, client management, and professional invoicing into a clean interface.
The standout feature, revealed by your help screen, is the offline capability. This elevates the app from a standard web tool to a powerful Progressive Web App (PWA), offering a significant competitive advantage and a seamless user experience, even with intermittent internet. You have built an excellent app that is already very close to being a commercially viable product.

Core Feature Analysis
Your app demonstrates a comprehensive feature set:
•	Time Tracking: The ability to start/stop timers is confirmed. The business logic to automatically round time up to the next 15 minutes is a professional touch that saves users manual effort and standardizes billing.
•	Client & Job Management: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for clients and jobs is the clear intention. The ability to set different rates (hourly, day, half-day) provides valuable flexibility.
•	Invoicing: The invoice generation process is robust, allowing for the inclusion of tracked sessions, manual items, and day-rate entries. The resulting PDF is professional and contains all necessary business and banking details.
•	Offline Functionality: This is a killer feature. Allowing a user to continue working offline and having their changes sync automatically when they reconnect is a significant technical achievement and a huge selling point.
•	Dashboard: Provides an essential at-a-glance overview of key financial metrics, keeping the user informed of their business's health.

Recommended Changes & Improvements
Here is an actionable list to refine the application, moving from a great prototype to a polished product.
High Priority (Core User Experience)
1.	Establish a Consistent Design System: This is the most important step to improve the app's professional feel.
o	Action: Choose one primary color (e.g., the blue from the navigation) for all major actions (Save, Create, Login). Use a consistent secondary colour (e.g., grey) for all Cancel or less important actions.
o	Action: Standardize all buttons to have the same border-radius, font weight, and hover effect.
o	Action: Remove the coloured backgrounds from form fields ("Business Details" page) and use a standard white or very light grey for all inputs across the app.
2.	Build Out List Views:
o	Action: Replace the placeholder text on the "Clients" and "Jobs" pages with a list or card-based layout. Each item in the list should display key information (e.g., Client Name, Phone Number) and have clear action icons (e.g., a pencil icon for "Edit", a trash can icon for "Delete").


3.	Implement the "Edit" Flow:
o	Action: Ensure the "pencil icon to edit" mentioned in the Help screen is implemented. Clicking this icon on a client or job in the list view should open the corresponding "Add/Edit" modal, pre-filled with that item's data.

Medium Priority (UX Polish)
1.	Refine the Dashboard Layout:
o	Action: Adjust the alignment and spacing of the three cards ("Running Timers," "Recent Activity," "Financial Metrics") to create better visual balance. Consider making them all the same height for a cleaner look.
2.	Improve Invoice Creation Feedback:
o	Action: In the "Create Invoice" modal, after a user selects a client and date range, provide immediate feedback. Instead of just "No sessions," show a loading indicator, and then dynamically display a list or count of the billable sessions that will be included (e.g., "5 sessions found will be added to this invoice").
Quick Wins (Minor Fixes)
1.	Update Invoice Footer Graphics: The logos in the PDF footer appear slightly pixelated. Replace them with high-resolution PNGs or, ideally, vector-based SVGs so they are sharp at any size.
2.	Typography Review: Do a quick pass to ensure headings, labels, and body copy have consistent font sizes and weights.
3.	Add a Favicon: Create a small version of your logo to be used as a favicon in the browser tab.

Recommended Additional Features
This list is focused on enhancing the core product and then adding features that directly support your goal of monetization.
Tier 1: Core Product Enhancements
•	Global Timer: Add a persistent "Start Timer" button to the main navigation header. This would allow a user to instantly start tracking time for a job from anywhere in the app, which is a huge workflow improvement.
•	Expense Tracking: Allow users to log job-related expenses (e.g., materials, mileage, software) and have the option to add these as billable items to an invoice.
•	Client-Level Dashboard: When a user clicks to view a specific client, show them a dedicated page with that client's history: a list of their jobs, all past invoices, total revenue generated from them, and their outstanding balance.
Tier 2: Monetization & Growth Features ("Building the Factory")
These are premium features that can justify a paid subscription plan.
•	Recurring Invoices: For users who work on retainers. Allow them to create an invoice template that is automatically generated and sent to a client on a weekly or monthly schedule.
•	Automated Payment Reminders: Automatically send reminder emails when an invoice is approaching its due date or is overdue. This saves your users an enormous amount of administrative hassle.
•	Client Portal: A simple, secure portal where your users' clients can log in to view their invoice history and make payments.
Tier 3: Long-Term Vision
•	Team Functionality: Allow an account owner to invite other users (team members). Team members could track their own time against jobs, but only the account owner (admin) could manage clients and billing.
•	Advanced Reporting: A dedicated "Reports" section with visual charts and data exports (e.g., CSV, PDF) for things like profit & loss, revenue by client, and time spent per job.
